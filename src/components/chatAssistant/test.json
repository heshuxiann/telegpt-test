It is a simple and transparent way to help projects get the support they need. In LaunchVote!, our community votes on projects they love and believe. The projects that receive the most votes get the opportunity to launch with KOM and benefit from our full support.What’s LaunchVote?  • It’s a monthly vote where our community decides which project launches with Kommunitas.  • Every month, we expect at least 20 projects to participate in the LaunchVote, and only 1 will be chosen to take the spotlight.  • With over 4,500 KOMV holders and 12,000 unique launchpad users, your project will be seen by the right crowd.How It Works:  1. Staking & Voting:   – Users stake 3,000 $KOM to receive a KOMV token, giving them voting power.2. Project Showcase:     – Your project is presented to our community, and they vote based on its vision and potential.3. Winning Opportunity:   – The project with the most votes wins the chance to launch with us without paying platform fees/ success fee!Fee to Join:  • A fee of 1,000,000 $KOM is required for your project team to join this program (approximately $1,000 USD at the current $KOM price).Additional Exposure:  • We’ll feature your project on our website and across our social channels (Twitter, Telegram) to give you extra highlight and exposure.Timing:  • Voting Round: March 10 – March 17, 2025  • Ideal For: Projects planning a TGE in March, April, or May.For a full overview, check out our Medium post:  https://medium.com/@kommunitasnet/introducing-launchvote-a-new-program-from-kommunitas-2775cae4d077Interested?

For the investor side experience, go to mbdao.deepfabrik.xyz and register with an email or Google account and link the wallet in the profile after that. I've minted one of the mock investment NFTs and some tokens into the wallet which grants the access to all investor side modules. Let me know if you have any questions or run into any trouble! We're currently in process of merging all latest and greatest updates into this environment for final testing before a production update so there may be occasional dropouts when the backend updates and reboots but that will stabilise latest on Friday."
